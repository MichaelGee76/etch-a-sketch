# etch-a-sketch
This is the final version of Etch-A-Sketch. A project from The Odin Project.
The goal was to understand and deepen the knowledge of DOM manipulation by Javascript.
Every element on the page is created by the JS . Most of the CSS style is created by JS too. It was fun to create the page, but I struggled a lot and it took my a while. But I've learned a lot:

Of course I got more and more comfortable with creating, styling, applying elements. I structured the script from the beginning, which was a very good helper to not get lost in my own code. I try to establish that for better readability and easier debugging.
While testing the results by console logs I got used to the dev tools to debug. especially the break points you can set, helped me a lot to understand what the code is actually doing. A very funny learning was, that HTML Collections look like Arrays, BUT you can't handle them like Arrays. Even though I've read about that in the course ressources, when it's time to put it into reality, everything is much more hard. It took me a decade to understand where I made the mistake. But it was fun, I had so many AHA-moments. Great project!
Last but not least, I got a better understanding of programming logic, but I know, that's just the beginning and the projects so far aren't so demanding. I mean for beginners yes, but there is a long way waiting for me.



What you can do here:
Whenever the mouse moves over the canvas, it will leave a pixely trail. So you can draw what ever you like. You can change the default black color to random rainbow colors. If you like you can switch back to black. The default grid can be changed by clicking the size button, a prompt will let you choose a size between 16-100. With the reset button.... sure, you can reset the canvas!

Have fun
